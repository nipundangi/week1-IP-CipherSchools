    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    <br>
    And sorry I could not travel both
    <br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    <br>
    And looked down one as far as I could
    <br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    <br>
    <br>
    Then took the other, as just as fair,
    <br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    <br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    <br>
    Though as for that the passing there
    <br>
    Had worn them really about the same.

    'The Starlight Night' was
        one of two poems which Hopkins
        sent to his mother as a birthday present,
    
    the other poem being 'God's Grandeur'.
            What a birthday present!
